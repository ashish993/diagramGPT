## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- An Azure OpenAI API account with active subscription
- Basic knowledge of system architecture concepts

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashish993/diagramGPT.git
   cd diagramGPT
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Create Streamlit Configuration Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .streamlit
   ```

2. **Set Up Azure OpenAI Credentials**
   - Copy the template configuration file:
     ```bash
     cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.template .streamlit/secrets.toml
     ```
   - Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with your Azure OpenAI credentials:
     ```toml
     AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "your-azure-endpoint"
     AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
     AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = "your-deployment-name"
     AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME = "your-model-name"
     ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control!

## üéÆ Usage Guide

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

2. **Creating Your First Diagram**
   1. Enter your architecture description in the text input area
      - Example: "Create a three-tier web application with a React frontend, Python API backend, and PostgreSQL database"
   2. Click "Generate Code" to create the initial diagram code
   3. Review and modify the generated code in the editor if needed
   4. Click "Generate Diagram" to visualize your architecture

3. **Modifying Diagrams**
   - Use the interactive code editor to:
     - Adjust component positions
     - Add/remove components
     - Modify relationships
     - Change styles and colors
   - Click "Generate Diagram" after each modification to update the visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Custom Styling
- Modify node shapes using the `shape` attribute
- Customize colors using hex codes or predefined colors
- Adjust line styles for connections
- Add custom icons to nodes

### Complex Diagrams
- Group related components using clusters
- Create multi-level hierarchies
- Add detailed annotations
- Use different arrow types for various relationships

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Application Won't Start**
   - Verify Python version: `python --version`
   - Check all dependencies are installed: `pip freeze`
   - Ensure Streamlit is properly installed: `streamlit --version`

2. **Diagram Generation Fails**
   - Verify Azure OpenAI credentials in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Ensure Azure OpenAI service is available

3. **Diagram Not Updating**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart the Streamlit server
   - Check for syntax errors in the diagram code
